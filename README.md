# Music-Genre-Classification


This project explores the classification of music genres using machine learning techniques. The aim is to classify songs as either 'Hip-Hop' or 'Rock' based on their audio features, without listening to the songs ourselves. Through data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and feature reduction using PCA, I trained a decision tree classifier to predict the genre of a song.
